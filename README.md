# DNS Query

I developed a DNS Interrogator in C which works as a DNS resolver, using requests to query DNS servers. The program receives a domain name or an IP address and prints a series of information about it. TCP or UDP transport protocol is used and the queries are structured according to 4.1 section from RFC 1035.
